# ITVE Landing Page Redesign
Project Overview

This project is a redesigned landing page for the Institutes of Technical & Vocational Education (ITVE).
The aim was to create a clean, modern, and easy-to-use landing page for students. As a first year student, using advanced Javascript or CSS was not possible, as I havent learned it yet. However, through multiple searches and browsing, I was able to learn the basics of both languages and create a better project. Pagination was a relatively new concept for me as well, but I tried my best to ensure the best work.

Pagination Explanation

The landing page uses section-based pagination. Each section takes full screen height and snaps while scrolling. It also takes into account mobile phone screens, for better working and functionality. Dot navigation is added to indicate the current section and allow users to navigate between sections. JavaScript is used to detect scroll position and update the active pagination dot.

Design Decisions

-Simple and clean layout for better readability
-Full screen sections to focus user attention
-Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
